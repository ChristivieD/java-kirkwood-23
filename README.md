## Java Kirkwood 2023
 This is the work  I complete for my CIS-171 
 Java course at Kirkwood Community College.
 Below is a journal of all the things I learned 
 throughout the class.
 
### Introduction
In the introduction unit we created accounts and 
installed software needed for the class.

Using [IntelliJ](https://jetbrains.com/idea) we created a module with a **Java 
class** inside it. Inside the class we created a main method 
that displays a message in terminal. We can type "sout" followed by the 
key to generate the `System.out.println()` statement.
``` Java 
public class MyClass {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println("My name is Christivie!");
 }
}
```
We initialized our project as a __Git repository__ and pushed our project code 
to [GitHub](https://gtihub.com). Our project includes a **.gitignore** 
file telling Git which files not to track.

Going forward, whenever I complete a task 
I will __Add-Commit-Push (ACP)__

git add . git commit -m "describe my work" git push origin main
